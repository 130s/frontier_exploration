frontier-exploration
====================

Implementation of frontier exploration for ROS using a custom costmap layer.

Runs an exploration task in a static or dynamic environment, bounded by a client-defined polygon. Passes movement commands to move_base.

Meant for use with the existing navigation stack (ie costmap_2d, move_base, etc.)
